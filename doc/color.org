* Color modifier

Color consists of field joined by :

** Color itself

#RRGGBB
red, gren, blue, etc.
#TTRRGGBB - with transparency, 0 - full opaque, FF - fully transparent

** Heatmap color

heatmap[<color-no>, <total-colors>]

** Hue modificator

h=<float: [0.0-1.0)> set hue, 0.0 - red, 0.333 - green, 0.5 - cyan, 0.666 - blue, 1.0 is considered below as red
h=<integer/float: [1-360]> set hue (in degrees), 1 and 360 - red, 120 - green, 180 - cyan, 240 - blue
h+<float: (0.0-1.0)> move to hue up, if hue was 180, h+0.5 moves it to 270, h+1.0 moves it to 360 (red)
h-<float: (0.0-1.0)> move to hue down, if hue was 180, h-0.5 moves it to 90, h-1.0 moves it to 0 (red)

** Saturation modificator

s=<float: [0.0-1.0]> set saturation, 0.0 - fully desaturated (white), 1.0 - fully saturated
s+<float: (0.0-1.0]> increase saturation, if saturation was 0.5, s+0.5 sets it to 0.75, i.e. for s+value new saturation is (old_value + (1.0 - old_value) * value)
s-<float: (0.0-1.0]> desaturate, if saturation was 0.5, s-0.5 sets it to 0.25, i.e. for s-value new saturation is (old_value - old_value * value)

** Brightness modificator

b=<float: [0.0-1.0]> set brightness, 0.0 - black, 1.0 - fully bright
b+<float: (0.0-1.0]> increase brightness, if brightness was 0.5, s+0.5 sets it to 0.75, i.e. for s+value new brightness is (old_value + (1.0 - old_value) * value)
b-<float: (0.0-1.0]> reduce brightness, if brightness was 0.5, s-0.5 sets it to 0.25, i.e. for s-value new brightness is (old_value - old_value * value)

** Transparency modificator

t=<float: [0.0-1.0]> set transparency, 0.0 - opaque, 1.0 - fully transparent
t+<float: (0.0-1.0]> increase transparency, if transparency was 0.5, s+0.5 sets it to 0.75, i.e. for s+value new transparency is (old_value + (1.0 - old_value) * value)
t-<float: (0.0-1.0]> reduce transparency, if transparency was 0.5, s-0.5 sets it to 0.25, i.e. for s-value new transparency is (old_value - old_value * value)

** Paleness modificator

It is a shortcut to change saturation and brightness simultanesously and in different directions

p+<float: (0.0-1.0]> make color more pale, the same as :s-<value>:b+<value> (works for colors and black/grey)
p-<float: (0.0-1.0]> make color less pale, the same as :s+<value>:b-<value> (hardly makes sense except for grey variants)
